## Subscription and Credit System

### **How Credits Work**
DriftDraft uses a **credit-based system** to allow users to generate AI-powered website plans. Users can either **subscribe for a monthly allowance** or **purchase top-up credits** as needed.

### **Credit Usage**
Credits are deducted when using AI-powered features:
- **1 credit per AI hint** during the planning process.
- **4 credits per full AI-generated website plan**.

When credits are deducted, the system prioritizes:
1. **Promotional credits** (if available).
2. **Monthly allowance credits** (only for subscription users).
3. **Top-up credits** (if no other credits are available).

📌 **Promotional and monthly allowance credits cannot be transferred.**  
📌 **Top-up credits can be transferred to another user (see details below).**

### **User Types & Their Credit System**

| User Type          | Credits & Limitations                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Anonymous Users** | Limited free credits (based on device/IP), non-resettable. |
| **Free-Tier Users** | No credits included. Must purchase credits to use the service. |
| **Paid-Tier Users** | Monthly credits at a lower cost, but they reset each month. |

---

### **Credit Reset & Expiry**
- **Monthly subscription credits reset** at the start of each billing cycle.
- **Top-up credits never expire** unless the user deletes their account.
- **Unused monthly credits do not roll over**—they expire at the end of the month.

---

### **Credit Transfers**
Users can **transfer top-up credits to another user** if:
- The recipient has an account with us under the specified **email address**.
- Only **top-up credits** are transferable. **Promotional and monthly credits cannot be transferred**.
- The transaction **only works if the receiving user exists in our system**.

📌 **If the recipient doesn’t have an account, the transfer will fail.**  

---

### **Payment & Subscription**
Users can **purchase credits or subscribe** by adding a **payment method first**.  
- Once a payment method is added, it will be used for **future credit top-ups or subscription payments**.
- Subscription renews automatically each billing cycle.
- All payments are securely processed via **Stripe's payment gateway**.

---

### **Checking Your Credits**
Users can **see their available credits** in the dashboard.  
For further details about their credit usage, users must **contact support**.

### **What Happens If I Run Out of Credits?**
- **Free & Anonymous Users:** Cannot generate more plans until they **purchase credits**.
- **Paid Users:** Can either **wait for the monthly reset** or **purchase top-up credits**.
