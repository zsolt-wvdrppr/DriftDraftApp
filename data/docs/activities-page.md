Welcome to your personal activity hub! The "My Activities" page is your central dashboard for managing all your website planner sessions. Whether you've just started a new plan or completed one, you can find and manage it here.

## Overview

The "My Activities" page provides a comprehensive list of all the website planner sessions you have started. Each entry represents a unique website plan you've worked on, allowing you to easily track your progress and revisit your ideas.

## Key Features

### 1. View All Your Sessions

All your website planner sessions, both in-progress and completed, are listed here. Each session in the list will typically display key information such as:

*   **Session Title:** A descriptive title for your plan, often generated based on your initial input.
*   **Date Created:** The date you started the session.
*   **Status:** Indicates whether the session is `In Progress` or `Completed`.

### 2. Continue an In-Progress Session

Did you get interrupted or need to gather more information? No problem. You can easily resume any session that is marked as `In Progress`.

*   **How to continue:** Simply find the session you wish to continue in the list and click on it. You will be taken back to the last step you were working on in the Website Planner, with all your previous answers saved.

### 3. Review Completed Plans

Once you have completed a website planner, the final blueprint is saved here.

*   **How to view:** Click on a `Completed` session to view the full, AI-generated website blueprint. You can review the strategy, copy the content, or use it as a reference for your web development project.

### 4. Manage Your Activities

Keeping your workspace tidy is easy. You can remove any sessions you no longer need.

*   **How to delete:** Each session will have an option to be deleted (e.g., a bin icon or a "Delete" button). Be careful, as this action is permanent and cannot be undone.
